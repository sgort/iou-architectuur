## What is this?

### What is IOU Architecture?

The Information Architecture Framework for IOU integrates semantic web technologies, decision models, and Dutch government standards into a unified system for managing regulatory compliance and spatial planning.

### Ecosystem Components

#### ⚙️ RONL Business API

The core business API layer that provides secure authentication and process orchestration for Dutch government services.

**Live App**: [mijn.open-regels.nl](https://mijn.open-regels.nl)

[View Documentation →](ronl-business-api/index.md){ .md-button }

#### 🖍️ Norm Editor

Vue/Quasar application for creating FLINT interpretations of legal sources: load a normative text, annotate fragments, and build Fact, Act, and Claim-duty frames that export to RDF in TriplyDB. Backed by NLP, unwrap, and wrap-up services.

#### ✏️ CPSV Editor

React-based application for creating CPSV-AP 3.2.0 compliant RDF/Turtle files for Dutch government services.

**Live App**: [cpsv-editor.open-regels.nl](https://cpsv-editor.open-regels.nl)

### Technology Stack

The IOU Architecture ecosystem is - apart from TriplyDB and eDOCS - built entirely on **open source technologies**:

### 🆕 What's New

<div class="grid cards whats-new-cards" markdown>

-   **⚙️ RONL Business API — v2026.09.15** · *September 2026*

    ---

    **The caseworker sees the process, and every operation is documented and checked**

    In the [Caseworker](ronl-business-api/user-guide/caseworker.md)'s Taken inbox, a task whose process is drawn in lanes now shows where it stands: its Awb phase on an eight-step stepper, its steps grouped per role with *jouw rol* marked, and the whole swimlane in an overview opened from the task or from ⌘K. The [OpenAPI description](ronl-business-api/reference/api-specification.md) now covers every operation, `/v1/m2m` included, and every documented operation is compared against a real response in the test run. `/v1/m2m` answers only allow-listed clients, the BRP proxy no longer writes BSNs into its log lines, and a failed citizen start explains why outside production. Links to the werkomgeving and the public site unfurl as preview cards, with acceptance marked and kept out of search engines, and v2026.09.15 gives every file an 85% branch margin. Both releases, and v2026.09.13's Flevoland sign-in, are in production.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full changelog](ronl-business-api/developer/changelog-roadmap.md)

-   **🖍️ Norm Editor — v2026.09.1** · *September 2026*

    ---

    **A choice of NLP model, and a test suite to go with it**

    Role detection is no longer fixed to one model at deploy time: `nlp-api` carries a registry of [selectable models](norm-editor/features/nlp-assistance.md#choosing-a-model) and the Act frame form gained a dropdown to pick one, with the response echoing the model actually used so a caller can tell a fallback from a hit. Model files moved out of the service image onto mounted storage, so adding one no longer means rebuilding. July filled the other gap: [automated tests](norm-editor/developer/testing.md) across all five services and a GitLab CI pipeline that blocks the image build when they fail — this component had none before.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full changelog](norm-editor/developer/changelog-roadmap.md)
    
-   **✏️ CPSV Editor — v2026.10.0** · *October 2026*

    ---

    **A published export survives its own round trip**

    Importing a published export no longer turns its [cell-level grounding](cpsv-editor/developer/cell-level-grounding.md) into Policy rules: a cell resource, a minted concept or a citation stub is typed `cprmv:Rule` too, and only subjects under the CPRMV rule base are now read as rules — the rest stay in the preserved DMN block, and a ConceptScheme no longer doubles on every republish. A fourth end-to-end journey drives the Amsterdam export through import, export and import again and requires the two exports to match. Clear Imported DMN Data now also clears the concepts it generated. Amsterdam's grounded cells name their concept (`skos:prefLabel`, `dct:type`), taken from the annotation export, and a survey of the rest of the model ends in a work list rather than guessed citations. A Dutch application profile for DMN, DMN-AP NL, is proposed to Forum Standaardisatie. Node moves to 24.21.0, and the [suite](cpsv-editor/developer/testing.md) stands at 776 tests and four end-to-end journeys, all passing.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full changelog](cpsv-editor/developer/changelog-roadmap.md)

-   **🔍 Linked Data Explorer — v2026.09.8** · *September 2026*

    ---

    **A promotion deploys in order, and every release carries its own SBOM**

    A push to `main` used to start three production deploys at once, and on the v2026.09.6 promotion the ROPA site finished before the backend had even begun building. [One promotion workflow](linked-data-explorer/developer/deployment.md#how-a-promotion-reaches-production) now decides what changed, deploys the backend first and releases the two sites only once it has succeeded; its path rules live in a tested script, and a promotion pull request still previews the real production site, by decision. Every deploy check now runs instead of the first failure hiding the rest, and `build-info.json` is read at start-up, closing a false pass in the very gate that proves a new build is serving. Each release now commits a CycloneDX SBOM, dependencies are audited daily on both `acc` and `main`, a lockfile that disagrees with `package.json` fails under its own name, and Renovate never offers a major's X.0.0. In the Modeler, both Thuisbatterij processes gain swimlanes and Dutch names, and "Aanvullende gegevens opvragen" finally has a form that can be deployed. The [suites](linked-data-explorer/developer/testing.md) stand at 3083 tests, all passing.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full changelog](linked-data-explorer/developer/changelog-roadmap.md)

-   **📜 CPRMV API — v0.4.1** · *June 2026*

    ---

    **CPRMV 0.4.1 conformance & reference resolution**

    RuleSets are now FRBR Works (`frbroo:F1_Work`); `/ref` auto-detects Juriconnect, ELI (to EU CELLAR), and CPRMV-API references; new `/cellar-by-celex` and `/cellar-by-eli` redirects; `unformat` works across all output formats; and the API now exposes a basic [MCP server](cprmv-api/reference/api-endpoints.md) at `/mcp`.

### 🎞️ Slide decks

Four topics also exist as slide decks. Each has a page showing every slide with its
text, next to the prose it summarises, and the PDF to download.

| Deck | Where | Slides | What it covers | As of | PDF |
|---|---|--:|---|---|---|
| [IOU Architecture](iou-architecture-deck.md) | Site-wide | 25 | The whole ecosystem, from quoted legal text to the decision the citizen sees — the four boards and the public knowledge base, then how it is built and safeguarded. Slides in Dutch | 30 Aug 2026 | [1.0 MB](assets/downloads/iou-architecture-deck.pdf) |
| [DMN to Linked Data Workflow](cpsv-editor/user-guide/dmn-workflow.md) | CPSV Editor · User Guide | 9 | From a legal body's DMN export to a tested decision service published as linked data — Amsterdam, SZW and Den Haag — and three questions for a standardisation body | 18 Sep 2026 | [261 KB](assets/downloads/dmn-to-linked-data-workflow.pdf) |
| [DSO Viewer APIs](linked-data-explorer/features/dso-viewer-apis-deck.md) | Linked Data Explorer · Features | 13 | How the DSO Viewer talks to the Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet — the proxy, the six upstream APIs, what each tab calls, and how an activity's dossier is assembled | 24 Sep 2026 | [184 KB](assets/downloads/dso-viewer-apis-deck.pdf) |
| [CI Posture Across Repos](contributing/ci-posture-deck.md) | Contributing | 5 | The four CI controls on the CPSV Editor and the Linked Data Explorer, and the delivery decision they lead to | 11 Sep 2026 | [127 KB](assets/downloads/ci-posture-across-repos-deck.pdf) |

A deck is a snapshot of its date, and each page states what it was checked against.

## How do I work on it?

### Development Workflow

- **Design** — for features where the UX is substantial, work starts in Claude Design; small changes skip straight to implementation.
- **Handoff** — a finished design leaves as a briefing package for the next stage, not as code.
- **Implementation** — happens in Claude Code, following red/green TDD: a failing test first, then the minimum code needed to pass it.
- **Release** — each of the application repositories cuts its own release with a versioning command tailored to its changelog.
- **Documentation** — once a component ships, these docs are brought back into sync with it.
