## What is Timeline Navigation?

(Basisregistratie Personen) at any point in time - past, present, or future.
This helps you:

- **Understand your history** — See how your household looked at any date
- **Plan for changes** — Explore how future life events affect your benefits
- **Check eligibility** — Understand which services you qualified for in the
  past
- **Verify data** — Confirm your BRP data is correct
