# Cross-cutting queue

What a component sync noticed but did not act on, waiting for the weekly Sunday
pass over `docs/en/contributing/**`.

**Why this file exists.** Until 20 September 2026 every component sync carried the
cross-cutting re-check with it. That made a sync too large to finish in one
sitting, and it meant the contributing pages were re-read only when a component
happened to ship. The two halves now run on different cadences — but a component
sync still *reads* the changelog that falsifies a contributing page, and that
observation is worth more on the day it is made than a week later, reconstructed.
So a sync records it here instead of acting on it.

**The contract.**

- A component sync **appends** one entry per release range it documents, with one
  bullet per cross-cutting fact: what changed, the evidence (the changelog entry,
  or the source file and what it says), and the page it bears on. If a release
  surfaced nothing cross-cutting, it writes that sentence with the date — a silent
  no-op cannot be told apart from a forgotten step.
- A component sync **never** edits a contributing page and **never** refreshes a
  `verified:` stamp. Both assert a re-check that did not happen.
- The weekly pass **verifies each entry against source** — an entry is a lead, not
  a finding — then strikes it, in the same commit as the corrections it produced.
  Anything it cannot verify stays, with a note saying why.

## Pending

Each section below was queued by one run and waits for the next weekly pass, which verifies
every entry against source before draining it. Everything queued on 24 and 26 September was
drained by the pass of 27 September, and everything queued from 27 September to 3 October by the pass of 4 October (see the table at the end).

### 4 October 2026 — carried over from the weekly pass

1. **The Semgrep Supply Chain triage of 30 September is recorded as accepted risk in the Semgrep UI.**
   Evidence: ronl-business-api `3d4913f` (PR #286) raised the `multer` floor and left the rest as
   accepted risk. The pass cannot read the Semgrep dashboard, so whether those entries exist, and with
   what reason, is unverified. Bears on: `dependency-scanning.md` (Semgrep Supply Chain). (Was 30
   September RONL Business API item 4.)

2. **The RONL Business API's "every file clears 85% branches" no longer holds.**
   Evidence: `73a6764` claimed all 32 files at 85% or above at v2026.09.15; the v2026.10.0 measurement of
   3 October 2026 (component sync) puts `BesluitOverzichtSection.tsx` at 80.43% — one branch above the
   80% floor. The pass did not run the suites; the next one that measures coverage should restate the
   margin on `coverage-floor.md`. (Was 30 September RONL Business API item 6, second half.)

## Drained

| Pass | Entries drained | Where they landed |
|---|---|---|
| 20 September 2026 | — | The first weekly pass predates this queue: the cross-cutting re-check ran inside the RONL Business API sync to v2026.09.9, which is the run that split the two halves apart |
| 27 September 2026 | All of 24 September LDE (1–10) and RBA (1–15); all of 26 September CPSV (1–7), LDE (1–11) and RBA (1–10, 12). LDE-26 #11 (Windows `test:scripts`) is a tooling defect, filed as iou-architectuur#105 item 5 rather than documented; RBA-24 #11 (preview opt-in) is documented on the component's own `cicd.md` and `backend-development.md`, and no contributing page contradicts it; LDE-24 #4 settled by reading the four App Services from Azure (LDE `NODE\|24-lts`, RBA `NODE\|22-lts`) | `supply-chain.md`, `dependency-scanning.md`, `controls.md`, `code-standards.md`, `branch-protection.md`, `coverage-floor.md`, `build-provenance.md`, `the-gitlab-mirror.md`, `index.md`, `ictu-dependency-guideline.md`, `ci-posture-deck.md`, `development-workflow/*`, `doc-architecture/*`; source defects to iou-architectuur#105 items 8–18 |
| 4 October 2026 | Every entry of 27 September (carry-overs 1–2), 28 September RBA (1–6), 30 September RBA (1–3, 5, 7–12, and the first halves of 4 and 6), 2 October CPSV (1–4), 3 October RBA (1–7) and 3 October LDE (1–9). Carry-over 2 (the `api-specification.md` comment) was fixed by the Linked Data Explorer sync of 3 October. 2 October CPSV #4 changed before it could land: `0bf8e46` runs the live-stack preflight only for journeys that need it. 3 October RBA #1 was partly right — the RONL Business API's first audit catch was #208 (adm-zip), #303 the first on `acc`'s own tree. 30 September #4 (Semgrep UI) and #6 (85% margin) carried over above | `supply-chain.md`, `dependency-scanning.md`, `ictu-dependency-guideline.md`, `controls.md`, `branch-protection.md`, `coverage-floor.md`, `build-provenance.md`, `the-gitlab-mirror.md`, `ci-posture-deck.md` (and its Dutch translation), `code-standards.md`, `index.md`, `development-workflow/*`, `doc-architecture/openapi-rendering.md` and `technology-stack.md`; source findings to ronl-business-api (Redis Renovate hold, `SECURITY-PIPELINE.md` `main` row, docker major approval), linked-data-explorer#254 and ttl-editor |
